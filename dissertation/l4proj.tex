In the UK, sailing races are scored with rules set by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA).
This scoring method results in many calculations which can be tedious to do by hand. As a result of this, most scoring is done using computer systems \citep{RYAscore}.

Castle Semple Sailing Club on Lochwinnoch, Scotland, currently uses a desktop application called Sailwave to score their races. This app has many issues, and the club desires a better system. The goal of this project is to design and build an improved system, that the sailing club can use to replace their current one \citep{RYAscore}.

Castle Semple Sailing Club sailing club on Lochwinnoch, Scotland, currently uses a desktop application called Sailwave to score their races. This app has many issues, and the club desires a better system. The goal of this project is to design and build an improved system, that the sailing club can use to replace their current one.

\section{The Client}
The Client for this project is Castle Semple Sailing Club. Located on Lochwinnoch near Glasgow, Scotland, It hosts many races and events throughout the year and uses a variety of different classes of dinghy. The majority of Castle Semple Sailing Club members have limited computer skills. Which needs to be taken into account when designing the solution.

The main point of contact with the club is Dr Simon Rogers, a member of the Castle Semple Sailing Club Committee. He was previously a lecturer at the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, and so he has technical knowledge that is relevant to the project. However, he is not able to spare the time to be directly involved in the project, so interaction with him is limited.

\section{The Problem}
According to the \citet{RYAscore} website, the scoring rules to be used in sailing races, described in high level terms, consists of the following:

A sailor receives points based on their finishing position (1 points for 1st, 2 points for 2nd etc.). The sailor with the lowest number of points as the end of a series (a collection of races) wins that series. Their place in the race is determined by the time they took to completed it, which is corrected by a handicap, so sailors in different boats with different capabilities can race fairly. These handicaps are set by the RYA, and in the case of dingy sailing, are known as the Portsmouth Yardstick Scheme
\citep{RYApy}

Additionally, a sailor can chose to not participate in any number of races in a series, in which case they are awarded a number of points that is greater than those any sailor who did compete received. A sailor can also start, but not finish a race, in which case they are awarded a slightly smaller number of points than not participating. Finally, a sailor can also be involved in running the race, in which case they are given a medium amount of points to reflect their contribution.

The current software, Sailwave, that the sailing club uses has a few limitations. Firstly, as it is a desktop program, it is limited to use on a computer that is owned by the club. This computer is old and slow, resulting in poor performance of the program, and cannot be easily replaced.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Main screen of the Sailwave Program \citep{sailwave}
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:Sailwave} 
\end{figure}

Additionally, the software itself is outdated and clunky, having been originally made in 2001 \citep{sailwave}. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Sailwave}, which shows the main screen of the Sailwave program. Notice how it is cluttered and confusing. 

In order to distribute the results of a race or series to the sailors, the results need to be printed out and manually sent out via another channel, such as email or posting the results on a notice board. This is not ideal. Also, the users of the software at Castle Semple Sailing Club have limited computer skills, so updating the program, moving the program to a new pc or selecting a new program to use is difficult.

This project sets out to design a new sailing race managing system, that solves the problem of calculating a leader board from data collected from races, using the system specified by the RYA. The system must improve apon Sailwave, and that provides some other features that the Castle Semple Sailing Club desires.


%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Background}
This section will take a dive into three currently existing sailing race management systems, and identify what can be learned from how they approached this problem.

\section{Sailwave}
Sailwave \citet{sailwave} is the software currently used by Castle Semple Sailing Club. It is free, but closed source, software, originally released in 2001.
The front page of its website \citep{sailwave} states: “Sailwave is a popular, fully-featured, easy-to-use, multi-lingual, sailing results/scoring application for Windows from XP to Windows 11“

Sailwave has a large list of features. Some notable ones, also taken from the front page of its website \citep{sailwave} are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Flexible scoring: score across all competitors or by fleet, club, nationality, etc.
    \item
    Publish retirement sheets, competitor lists, alternative penalty sheets, etc.
    \item
    Send your news (reports, results, and photos) directly to the Yachts and Yachting magazine website.
    \item
    Publish directly into programs like Microsoft Word and Excel etc
    \item
    Publish to web documents (HTML) for upload to websites or printing or emailing. Integrated support for FTP/SFTP/SSH/FTPS.
\end{itemize}

It can be seen that the software contains a myriad of different features and use cases. The front page of the it’s website lists 33 different features, some of which were shown above. It can be deduced from this that the program is bloated, cluttered and confusing.
Figure \ref{fig:SailwaveEmpty} shows the page a user is greeted with upon first startup of the program. There are many bottoms and menus presented in the tool bar, but many are greyed out and it is not immediately clear where to start.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/SailwaveEmpty.png} 

    \caption{Start-up screen of the Sailwave program \citep{sailwave}
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:SailwaveEmpty} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:SailwaveEdit} shows Sailwave when a user has started a new series and is attempting to edit one of the entries. A massive amount of different fields are available to be filled out across multiple tabs. It is not clear which cell in the excel-like table corresponds with which entry in the dialogue box. It is clear that Sailwave provides lots of support for various uses, but how much of what Sailwave does it directly relevant to a small sailing club? The importance of restricting the features of programs is shown in an article by \citet{leanSoftware}. In it, he says that bloated software takes more time to design, code and debug. This can be seen in Sailwave, as to reach its current state, the software has been continually added to over the past 22-years, since its first release to 2001 \citep{sailwave}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/Sailwave_edit.png} 

    \caption{Editing a cell in the Sailwave Program \citep{sailwave}
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:SailwaveEdit} 
\end{figure}

Sailwave does succeed in presenting some of its information, mainly the race details shown in the excel-like table as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Sailwave}, in a clear and easy to understand manner. The format of the data takes after a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet \citep{Excel}, shown in figure \ref{fig:Excel}, The resemblance is apparent. As many people are familiar with spreadsheets, past skills can make it more easy for a users to understand Sailwave.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/Ecel.png} 

    \caption{Example of a common Excel spreadsheet \citep{Excel}
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:Excel} 
\end{figure}

Overall, the standardised excel-like format Sailwave uses is a good lesson that can be learned from when designing a new solution, particularly as the members of Castle Semple Sailing Club are already used to Sailwave. The over-complexity and feature-bloat of Sailwave presents an opportunity to improve upon it, by cutting out many of the features that aren't relevant to a small-scale sailing club.

\section{Club manager}
\citet{ClubManager} is a web-based application that takes different approach. It seeks to provide a complete platform to manager every part of a sailing club, from race scoring to membership management to morning booking. It is purchased via a subscription. 
While the scope of club manager is obviously far beyond the problem this project seeks to tackle, it does show an example of a more professional solution. As Sailing Club Manager is paid software, and the don’t provide any example on their website, the exact functionality of it cannot be analysed and compared.
Focusing in on the race scoring feature, the website \citep{ClubManager}, shown in figure \ref{fig:ClubManager},  lists, among others, the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Flexible scoring: score across all competitors or by fleet, club, nationality, etc.
    \item
    It can be used on any device that can browse the internet including tablets, Macs and PCs. 
    \item
    It's easy to use and doesn't require Race officers to learn complicated software. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/ClubManager.png} 

    \caption{Race scoring Features page on the Sailing Club Manager Website \citep{ClubManager}
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:ClubManager}
\end{figure}
Compared to Sailwave, the features are much smaller in number, and directed towards a simple use-case, Rather than the sheer density of features Sailwave provides. This shows that this software is much more directed towards ease of use and practicality, than Sailwave. Due to the lack of tech skills among the members of Castle Semple Sailing Club, having a new solution take an approach more similar to club manager may be beneficial.

As the scope of Sailing Club Manager far exceeds that of what Castle Semple Sailing Club want, it can be used as an example of what to stay away from. If the scope and features of a new solution begin to resemble that of Sailing Club Manager, then they should be reduced.

\section{General points}

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.

    This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }
    
\caption{The Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from arbitrary probability distributions, 
specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise. 

\begin{table}[]

    captions go above the table, not below. Do not add additional rules/lines to tables. }\label{tab:operators}

\subsection{Code}

Avoid putting large blocks of code in the report (more than a page in one block, for example). Use syntax highlighting if possible, as in Listing \ref{lst:callahan}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, float, caption={The algorithm for packing the $3\times 3$ outer-totalistic binary CA successor rule into a 
    $16\times 16\times 16\times 16$ 4 bit lookup table, running an equivalent, notionally 16-state $2\times 2$ CA.}, label=lst:callahan]
    def create_callahan_table(rule="b3s23"):
        """Generate the lookup table for the cells."""        
        s_table = np.zeros((16, 16, 16, 16), dtype=np.uint8)
        birth, survive = parse_rule(rule)

        # generate all 16 bit strings
        for iv in range(65536):
            bv = [(iv >> z) & 1 for z in range(16)]
            a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p = bv

            # compute next state of the inner 2x2
            nw = apply_rule(f, a, b, c, e, g, i, j, k)
            ne = apply_rule(g, b, c, d, f, h, j, k, l)
            sw = apply_rule(j, e, f, g, i, k, m, n, o)
            se = apply_rule(k, f, g, h, j, l, n, o, p)

            # compute the index of this 4x4
            nw_code = a | (b << 1) | (e << 2) | (f << 3)
            ne_code = c | (d << 1) | (g << 2) | (h << 3)
            sw_code = i | (j << 1) | (m << 2) | (n << 3)
            se_code = k | (l << 1) | (o << 2) | (p << 3)

            # compute the state for the 2x2
            next_code = nw | (ne << 1) | (sw << 2) | (se << 3)

            # get the 4x4 index, and write into the table
            s_table[nw_code, ne_code, sw_code, se_code] = next_code

        return s_table

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/boxplot_finger_distance.pdf}    

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
