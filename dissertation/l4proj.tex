In the UK, sailing races are scored with rules set by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA).
This scoring method results in many calculations which can be tedious to do by hand. As a result of this, most scoring is done using computer systems \citep{RYAscore}.

Castle Semple Sailing Club on Lochwinnoch, Scotland, currently uses a desktop application called Sailwave to score their races. This app has many issues, and the club desires a better system. The goal of this project is to design and build an improved system, that the sailing club can use to replace their current one \citep{RYAscore}.

Castle Semple Sailing Club sailing club on Lochwinnoch, Scotland, currently uses a desktop application called Sailwave to score their races. This app has many issues, and the club desires a better system. The goal of this project is to design and build an improved system, that the sailing club can use to replace their current one.

\section{The Customer}
The main customer for this project is Dr. Simon Rogers, a member of Castle Semple Sailing Club who came up with the idea. Simon is also a senior lecturer in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow so he is able to provide some technical advice. However, he is not able to spare the time to be directly involved in the project, so interaction with him is limited. The majority of Castle Semple Sailing Club members, on the other hand, have limited computer skills. This needs to be taken into account in the rest of the project, and the end product must be designed with this in mind.

The Sailing Club itself is located on Lochwinnoch near Glasgow, Scotland. It hosts many races and events throughout the year and uses a variety of different classes of dinghy. 

\section{The Problem}
According to the \citet{RYAscore} website, the scoring rules to be used in sailing races, described in high level terms, consists of the following:

A sailor receives points based on their finishing position (1 points for 1st, 2 points for 2nd etc.). The sailor with the lowest number of points as the end of a series (a collection of races) wins that series. Their place in the race is determined by the time they took to completed it, which is corrected by a handicap, so sailors in different boats with different capabilities can race fairly. These handicaps are set by the RYA.

Additionally, a sailor can not participate in any number of races in a series, in which case they are awarded a number of points that is grater than those any sailor who was in the race revived. A sailor can also start, but not Finnish a race, in which case they are awarded a slightly smaller number of points than not participating. Finally, a sailor can also be involved in running the race, in which case they are given a medium amount of points to reflect this.

There are also a number of other exceptions and special cases.

The current software, Sailwave, that the sailing club uses has a few limitations. Firstly, as it is a desktop program, it is limited to use on a computer that is owned by the club. This computer is old and slow, resulting in poor performance of the program, and cannot be easily replaced. Additionally, the software itself is outdated and clunky, having been originally made in 2001 \citep{sailwave}. In order to distribute the results of a race or series to the sailors, the results need to be printed out and manually sent out via another channel, such as email or posting the results on a notice board. This is not ideal. Also, the users of the software at Castle Semple Sailing Club have limited computer skills, so updating the program, moving the program to a new pc or selecting a new program to use is difficult.

This project sets out to design a new sailing race managing system, that improves upon Sailwave, and that provides some other features that the Castle Semple Sailing Club desires.

\chapter{Background}
What did other people do, and how is it relevant to what you want to do?
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item
      Don't give a laundry list of references.
    \item
      Tie everything you say to your problem.
    \item
      Present an argument.
    \item Think critically; weigh up the contribution of the background and put it in context.    
    \item
      \textbf{Don't write a tutorial}; provide background and cite
      references for further information.
\end{itemize}

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
What is the problem that you want to solve, and how did you arrive at it?
\section{Guidance}
Make it clear how you derived the constrained form of your problem via a clear and logical process. 

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
How is this problem to be approached, without reference to specific implementation details? 
\section{Guidance}
Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
What did you do to implement this idea, and what technical achievements did you make?
\section{Guidance}
You can't talk about everything. Cover the high level first, then cover important, relevant or impressive details.



\section{General points}

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure

    This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }
    
\caption{The Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from arbitrary probability distributions, 
specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise.

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
