Two slugs the same can be created from different names

There is probly a better way of quring the database useing SQl rules like join, rarther tan acsessing items exlipcitly.

didnt use external app as do not need registation functionality, only login

can still acsess cached admin login page when loged out

did not test login page because couldnt check if user would authenticate and taking too long - removed tests
same with logout ^
